\noindent \textbf{\Large{Task 1: Acquire, preprocess, and analyze the data}}\\
\noindent \textbf{Dataset 1.} We chose to use numPy for the first dataset since the values were numerical and numPy seemed like a better tool. There were no duplicate rows in this dataset\\
\noindent \textbf{Dataset 2.} We made the choice of using pandas for the second dataset since this one used categorical classifications and Pandas seemed like a better tool for that. There were no rows with missing values or values that were not in the specified format (P,A or N; B or NB), so none were removed because of that. However, there were 147 duplicate rows that we chose to remove from the Dataset. \\
